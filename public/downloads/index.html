            "content": "Modern systems are increasingly decentralised and autonomous; therefore their implementation is increasingly difficult and error prone. These systems should guarantee continuous service, be resilient to faults, self-adaptable to changes, and resistant to security attacks; in particular, sensitive data must be kept confidential and user privacy and anonymity preserved. This is even more important in the case of embedded an cyber-physical systems, where a software misbehaviour may have disruptive effects on the surrounding environment. The Laboratory of Models and Applications and Distributed Systems (MADS) aims at contributing effective answers for the correct design and implementation of distributed, autonomous, embedded systems. In particular we focus on\n formal models for supporting the correct design of trustworthy distributed systems engineering techniques to implement these systems, in particular in embedded and IoT scenarios; strategies for the coordination of distributed autonomous systems; methods and tools to protect resources and information from misuse; verification of security properties of authentication and communication protocols.  The research unit is funded by the European Union, the Italian Ministry for the University and Research (MIUR), the University of Udine and industrial partners.\n",

            "content": "A library for Bigraphs and Bigraphic Reactive Systems. Bigraphs and Bigraphical Reactive Systems are a modern, graphical calculus for the description of the syntax and semantics of systems in terms of the orthogonal notions of connectivity and locality but have been successfully applied also in other fields such as knowledge representation and manipulation. Bigraphs were proposed by Robin Milner and colleagues in 2000, and have been under development since. We refer the reader to Milner\u0026rsquo;s book The space and motion of communicating agents or to this site for a brief introduction to bigraphs. (Several works and projects involving bigraphs are collected at this site.) jLibBig aims to offer an implementation of bigraphic reactive systems but also to provide some tools and the infrastructure for extending them or implement the brand new flavours of bigraphs in order to meet requirements of a wider spectrum of scenarios. Part of this extensibility is achieved thanks to the attached properties which allows to dynamically extend the structure of bigraphs by attaching attributes or properties (thay may be mutable) to e.g. nodes. For instance, attached properties can be used to store concrete values such as ip addresses or user permissions without the need to encode all this information in the standard bigraphic language reducing the burden of the encoding and resulting in a streamlined model without loss of information thanks to this new layer of abstraction. Matchings and rewritings can be customised to take into account also attached properties and hence, the need to re-implement the whole bigraph framework to meet particular use cases is drastically reduced. The library provides a default implementation of bigraphs. The classes Bigraph and BigraphBuilder provides methods for assembling bigraphs programmatically but importers from some textual representations are offered. Milner\u0026rsquo;s algebra is supported in the form of methods exposed by Bigraph and BigraphBuilder implementing operations (such as composition, juxtaposition, or nesting) and elementary bigraphs (such as identities or ions). However, BigraphBuilder can be used to modify bigraphs more freely by not necessarily constructive operations. For instance, the following Java program defines a signature with a single control (called Printer) with two ports, then constructs the bigraph pictured below.\nimport it.uniud.mads.jlibbig.core.std.*; public class SimpleBig { public static void main(String[] args) { SignatureBuilder signatureBuilder = new SignatureBuilder(); signatureBuilder.add(new Control(\u0026#34;Printer\u0026#34;, true, 2)); Signature signature = signatureBuilder.makeSignature(); BigraphBuilder builder = new BigraphBuilder(signature); OuterName spooler = builder.addOuterName(\u0026#34;Spooler\u0026#34;); OuterName network = builder.addOuterName(\u0026#34;Network\u0026#34;); Root root = builder.addRoot(); Node printer = builder.addNode(\u0026#34;Printer\u0026#34;,root,spooler,network); builder.addSite(root); builder.addSite(printer); builder.addInnerName(\u0026#34;Network\u0026#34;,network); Bigraph bigraph = builder.makeBigraph(); System.out.println(bigraph); } } Attached properties can be used to dynamically attach additional information. For instance, the printer node can be decorated with the default paper format or its network alias:\nprinter.attachProperty(new ProtectedProperty\u0026lt;String\u0026gt;(\u0026#34;NETWORK_ALIAS\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;Lab printer\u0026#34;)); Properties can be easily read:\nPaper format = printer.\u0026lt;Paper\u0026gt;getProperty(\u0026#34;DEFAULT_FORMAT\u0026#34;).get(); or written:\nprinter.\u0026lt;Paper\u0026gt;getProperty(\u0026#34;DEFAULT_FORMAT\u0026#34;).set(Paper.A4); Much of the information expressible by attached properties can be easily encoded in the bigraphic language, but there are cases requiring to extend (and hence re-implement) the bigraphic machinery. For instance, spatial information can be represented bigraphically, but in a rather abstract way. What if we are interested in the nearest printer or in the access point with the strongest signal? The following concise example illustrates how the matcher can be instructed to consider access points (nodes decorated with the “AP_C” control) within the range.\nMatcher matcher = new Matcher(){ protected boolean areMatchable(Bigraph agent, Node nodeAgent, Bigraph redex, Node nodeRedex) { if(super.areMatchable(agent,nodeAgent,redex,nodeRedex)){ if(nodeAgent.getControl.equals(AP_C)) return checkDistance(nodeAgent); else return true; } ;return false; } }; for(Match m : matcher.match(bigraph,redex)){ doSomethingWithThisMatch(m); }; However optimal solutions are supported too:\nMatcher matcher = new WeightedMatcher(){ protected int matchingWeight(Bigraph agent, Node nodeAgent, Bigraph redex, Node nodeRedex) { if(nodeAgent.getControl.equals(AP_C) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; nodeRedex.getControl.equals(AP_C)) return getDistance(nodeAgent); else return super.matchingWeight(agent,nodeAgent,redex,nodeRedex); } }; Downloads and resources Library classes and interfaces The core library provides the main infrastructure of LibBig, the abstractions shared by bigraphs and their main extensions and a default implementation of BRS (with abstract names). The ldb library implements the \u0026ldquo;directed bigraphs\u0026rdquo; variant.\nOrdinary and weighted matches are implemented as constraint satisfaction problems which are then solved by means of the CHOCO Solver.\n GitHub repository; JAR class file version 0.2, without dependencies.

            "title": "Distributed subgraph isomorphism",
            "content": "Un algoritmo distribuito per il problema del subgraph isomorphism Anna Becchi - Idriss Riouak Si consideri un sistema multi-agente, in cui una flotta di agenti comunicanti (ad esempio robot o droni) stanno visitando un ambiente sconosciuto (un edificio, un territorio) ed ognuno sta raccogliendo gradualmente informazioni sulla topologia del luogo. Ogni nodo ha una visione soggettiva ed incompleta del contesto e, a causa di limitazione di banda, tempo o memoria dei nodi, non esiste un nodo che ha la visione complessiva del grafo dell\u0026rsquo;ambiente. In tale situazione, sorge il problema del distributed subgraph isomorphism, ossia trovare un isomorfismo tra un certo grafo dato e un sottografo del grafo host complessivo (e distribuito). Questo problema può essere usato per determinare vie di fuga o di accesso a zone impervie, specifici ambienti, ecc. In questo progetto si presenta una soluzione a tale problema, partendo dalla definizione formale fino ad arrivare all\u0026rsquo;implementazione che simula l\u0026rsquo;ambiente fisico di esecuzione, con interfaccia grafica e una classe di file di test.\nE' possibile scaricare l\u0026rsquo;intero progetto da GitHub. Per eseguire il progetto è sufficiente lanciare lo script `./dsquack' Tutte le informazioni riguardanti la struttura delle cartelle dei sorgenti, le modalità di esecuzione e di testing e la lettura dei messaggi di log interni si possono trovare nel file README. Hint: un comodo ambiente di sviluppo per analizzare i sorgenti ed eseguire il progetto è `IntelliJ Idea'.\nL’ambiente di sviluppo è stato scelto in modo da poter evidenziare solamente le caratteristiche più rilevanti del problema. Il sistema è stato implementato in Akka, un toolkit costituito da un insieme di librerie open source per la progettazione e creazione di sistemi distribuiti e concorrenti, con supporto alla scalabilità e alla fault tollerance, eseguibile su una JVM. Il toolkit è disponibile sia per il linguaggio imperativo usato (Java) che per il funzionale Scala e attualmente la versione più aggiornata è la 2.5.4. Akka si basa sul modello ad attori: un’astrazione utilizzata per effettuare analisi sulla concorrenza e per la progettazione ad alto livello di sistemi distribuiti. Lo scopo del modello è quello di risolvere le questioni relative alla concorrenza e alla memoria condivisa, eliminandola completamente e sgravando dunque il programmatore da questi problemi. Le comunicazioni tra le varie componenti del sistema sfruttano principalmente il meccanismo di Distributed Publish Subscribe in Cluster oﬀerto da Akka. Esso consente di comunicare con un insieme di attori che si dichiarano interessati a un determinato topic senza che il mittente conosca gli ActorRef dei destinatari. Per questi motivi risulta una funzionalità particolarmente adatta al sistema in questione perché garantisce una massima location transparency tra i diversi Actor System. Gli attori membri di un cluster possono iscriversi a un path oppure a un subject; l’invio di un messaggio tramite il DistribuitedPubSubMediator di Akka può essere eseguito in modalità:\n SendToAll / Publish, il messaggio viene ricevuto da tutti gli attori iscritti, eventualmente settando il parametro allButSelf che esclude il mittente; Send, il messaggio viene ricevuto da un solo attore iscritto al cluster, eventualmente speciﬁcando la preferenza location aﬃnity.

            "content": "Lorenzo Bazzana, Marino Miculan (MADS lab, University of Udine)\nMichele Codutti (Danieli Automation)\nOperation Technology, i.e. the hardware and software that monitor and control industrial equipment, assets, processes and events, is required to respect high standards of security and reliability. Unfortunately, the analysis and security assessment of OT is less mature than that of Information Technology. In fact, products and components used in industrial plants often have issues that must be dealt with. Most of the times, these issues are not very dangerous, e.g. because they are hard to exploit, but sometimes… this is not the case.\nIn this page, we document the discovery of a backdoor in an industrial Access Point. This work has been carried out within a cooperation between the MADS Lab of the University of Udine and Danieli Automation, aiming to analyze vulnerabilities of the devices that Danieli Automation re-sell or produce. We provide this information for academic and teaching purposes, as it is a good example about these activities are carried out in practice.\nAnalysis The device is an 802.11 b/g/n access point Oring Net IAP-420+ that is installed inside a local unit, near the industrial machine that it is connected to. Using the wireless network provides by the AP, an operator can connect to the machine for diagnostic and maintenance purposes, from a safe distance from the machine itself. The analysis followed these steps:\n Reading the manuals to understand how the device works and define the first attack surface Access to the device to verify the attack surface Proper vulnerability assessment to determine the software components that are running and the known vulnerabilities present  After these steps, we found that some default settings yield to vulnerabilities easily exploitable; these issues can be fixed by suitably reconfiguring the AP.\nBut there was something stranger in the port scan report.\nTo configure the access point, the manual describes only one way: via web interface. But we found that a telnet server was listening on the default port (23/TCP). Maybe there is also a CLI interface via telnet? Connecting to that port we receive a login prompt, for which the admin credentials of the web interface do not work:\n\nThis is a hint that this telnet server is not meant to be used by the user or admin. So, let’s see if we can exploit this access retrieving those credentials.\nWe can try a brute force attack to the telnet server, but it is slow and with low success probability. An alternative is to seek the credentials inside the firmware image, which is available to customers from the manufacturer’s website. Using the firmware mod kit the firmware was easily unpacked and inside it looks like a standard Linux embedded system with a twist: there are two /etc directories, one properly named “/etc” and one named “/etc_ro”. It seems that the firmware is designed to have some configuration files that are immutable and some not.\nIn the “/etc/inittab” we can locate the main init script, which is named “/etc/rcS”. Looking into it we found our treasure: the root password is set with a fixed value, every time the AP is rebooted.\n\nUsing these credentials, any user connected to the AP (even via WiFi) can immediately login as root, and therefore gain the complete control of the AP – the worst possible scenario. (Password is obfuscated in order to not disclose the specific credentials.)\nFrom this script, we can figure out that the telnet service has been activated for debugging purposes; the service should have been removed in the released firmware.\n(In the case we could not find the password in clear in the firmware, we could have tried to reverse the hash of the password from the “/etc/passwd” file, via rainbow tables.)\nRemediation plan When we discovered this vulnerability, we immediately contacted the product manufacturer. The correct remediation plan is to remove the telnet service and the password from the firmware. A temporary solution is to login as root (exploiting the vulnerability) and change the root password; however, it is important to notice that this must be done at every reboot of the AP, since the init script restores the original (and discoverable) password.\nA firmware update (Ver 2.01e) was provided by Oring in a week. Before upgrading our device, we analyzed the new firmware to check if the issue was addressed correctly.\nUsing the same tools of the trade we unpacked the new firmware and re-check the init-script:\n\nThe image shows a side-by-side comparison obtained by the diff command. The old version of the file is on the left the new is on the right. The red lines are what is missing from the old file in the new (the password is obfuscated as before).\nAll the commands that are creating the root user, changing his password and launching telnet server were removed. The root user is present in the “/etc/passwd” file but the password is hashed.\nDownload links (registration required):\nhttps://oringnet.com/en-global/products/download/638 for IAP420\nhttps://oringnet.com/en-global/products/download/637 for IAP420+ (POE)\nConclusions In this report we have described the discovery of a severe vulnerability of an industrial WiFi access point. The vulnerability is a hidden feature, which allows for the execution of a complete remote shell with root privileges. This vulnerability is officially described in the CVE Id CVE-2022-3203, with a severity grade of 9.8 out of 10. The CVSS vector is: 3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.\nThis result is one of the results of the fruitful collaborations between the MADS lab of the University of Udine and Danieli Automation. It confirms once more the need for deep and careful analysis of software and hardware components for OT. So: keep hacking!\n",

About 40 people have gathered, from the universities of Pisa, Udine, Camerino, the IMT of Lucca, the GSSI of L\u0026rsquo;Aquila and the CNR. The project is about trustworthiness of \u0026ldquo;smart systems\u0026rdquo;, so the MADS lab will have the possibility to work in strict contact with the top research groups of the field, in Italy and abroad. BTW, we have open post-doc positions in this project, so if you are interested please contact the Udine site leader (Marino Miculan)\n",
