Operation Technology, i.e. the hardware and software that monitor and control industrial equipment, assets, processes and events, is required to respect high standards of security and reliability. Unfortunately, the analysis and security assessment of OT is less mature than that of Information Technology. In fact, products and components used in industrial plants often have issues that must be dealt with.</description>

      <description>A new version of jLibBig, the Java Library for Bigraphs, has been released today. The new version is codenamed &amp;ldquo;Easter&amp;rsquo;s Eve&amp;rdquo;.
With respect to the previous one, these are the main improvements:
 Added the support for (Local) Directed Bigraphs, a generalisation of pure bigraphs where the link graph structure is more symmetric. Ported the Matching algorithm to version 4 of Choco solver. Various bug fixings and improvements.  As usual, the JAR library is available for download at the corresponding web page.</description>

      <description>The kick-off meeting of the PRIN 2017 project &amp;ldquo;IT MATTERS&amp;rdquo; has been in Pisa, on October 14. About 40 people have gathered, from the universities of Pisa, Udine, Camerino, the IMT of Lucca, the GSSI of L&amp;rsquo;Aquila and the CNR. The project is about trustworthiness of &amp;ldquo;smart systems&amp;rdquo;, so the MADS lab will have the possibility to work in strict contact with the top research groups of the field, in Italy and abroad.</description>
