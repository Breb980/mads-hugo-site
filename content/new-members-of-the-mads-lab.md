We have the great pleasure to welcome two new members of the MADS laboratory: Michele Pasqua and Claude Stolze. Michele comes from the University of Verona, Italy, and he is an expert in formal models and abstract interpretation, especially for IoT applications. Claude comes from IRIF, the Research Institute on the Foundations of Computer Science at the University of Paris, and has strong expertise in type theory and proof assistants. Welcome!
