A new version of jLibBig, the Java Library for Bigraphs, has been released today. The new version is codenamed "Easter's Eve".

With respect to the previous one, these are the main improvements:

*   Added the support for (Local) Directed Bigraphs, a generalisation of pure bigraphs where the link graph structure is more symmetric.
*   Ported the Matching algorithm to version 4 of Choco solver.
*   Various bug fixings and improvements.

As usual, the JAR library is available for download at the [corresponding web page](https://mads.uniud.it/downloads/libbig/). Have fun, and let we know the projects you are using this library for!
