The kick-off meeting of the PRIN 2017 project "IT MATTERS" has been in Pisa, on October 14. About 40 people have gathered, from the universities of Pisa, Udine, Camerino, the IMT of Lucca, the GSSI of L'Aquila and the CNR. The project is about trustworthiness of "smart systems", so the MADS lab will have the possibility to work in strict contact with the top research groups of the field, in Italy and abroad. BTW, we have open post-doc positions in this project, so if you are interested please contact the Udine site leader (Marino Miculan)
